# Project Name

## Project Overview

This project aims to utilize an ESP32 development board and LoRaWAN communication module to read data from a smart electricity meter's D0 interface and upload it to The Things Network (TTN). This solution enables remote monitoring and management of smart meter data, providing convenience for energy management.

## Key Features

1. **Integrated ESP32 Development Board:** Utilizing the ESP32 development board for robust computation and communication capabilities, ideal for IoT device development.

2. **LoRaWAN Communication Module:** Integration of a LoRaWAN communication module for long-range, low-power wireless communication, enabling remote data transmission.

3. **D0 Interface Data Reading:** Leveraging the D0 interface of the smart electricity meter to read data, including energy consumption, voltage, current, and other relevant information.

4. **Data Upload to TTN:** Uploading data read from the meter to The Things Network via LoRaWAN, enabling cloud storage and analysis of the data.

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 Development Board
- LoRaWAN Communication Module
- Smart Electricity Meter (supporting D0 interface)
- Relevant sensors (optional, based on project requirements)

## Software Requirements

- Arduino IDE (or other suitable IDE for ESP32)
- Relevant ESP32 and LoRaWAN libraries
- The Things Network (TTN) account

## Getting Started

1. **Environment Setup:** Install the Arduino IDE and configure the ESP32 development environment.

2. **Library Installation:** Install the necessary ESP32 and LoRaWAN libraries.

3. **TTN Configuration:** Create an application and device on The Things Network, obtaining the device's Device EUI, Application EUI, Application Key, and other required information.

4. **Modify Configuration File:** In the project code, modify the configuration file to include the device information obtained from TTN.

5. **Upload Code:** Upload the modified code to the ESP32 development board.

6. **Deploy Device:** Connect the ESP32 to the LoRaWAN communication module and then to the D0 interface of the smart electricity meter.

7. **Monitor Data:** Monitor device data on the TTN console to ensure successful data upload.
